# debian brightness-scripts
very small scripts that i used to manage brightness

## Disclaimers
    - I used this on debian on my intel t14 since xbacklight
        refused to work
    - keeping this incase i stumble on to an OS where xbacklight
    isn't an option
    - bad security?

## "setup"
this does require some additional configuration:
    - move these scripts to /usr/local/bin or something in $PATH
    - find where the screen brightness file is 
        and chown (or chmod) it with a user
